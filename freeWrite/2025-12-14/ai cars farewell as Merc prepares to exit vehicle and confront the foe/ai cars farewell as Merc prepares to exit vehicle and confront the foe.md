It's raining, a thick mist pouring into the night's neon lights, and on the city outskirts, a Merc pulls up alongside the highway.

V parks the car, and grabs their sword from the passenger seat.

%% maybe this ig to ig event (aside, yes, some events don't leave ig?) is if V has been joking 'wish me luck' up till this point. this is first time %%
[[SimToIg V prepares to disembark ahead of the fight.]]
![[IgToIg DELEMAIN WISHES V LUCK]]

[[EVENT V ignores the comment]]
%% The lack of context action taken, is an action. what sim action does PC perform instead? Or could perform %%
	- and exits the car
	- checks their sword/ gear a moment
%% I doubt Delemain should react to comment being 'ignored' It was heard, and that's enough.%%
