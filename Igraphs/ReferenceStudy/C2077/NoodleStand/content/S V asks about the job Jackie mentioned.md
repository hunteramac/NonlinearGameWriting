V sits down at the other stool

V
Mentioned something about a surprise yesterday.
Am I remembering right, or... Just had a brain fart.

[[E V experiences visual artifacts due to system malfunction]]

JACKIE
(finishes a bite, wipes mouth with back of hand)
Probably both. Cause you usually forget shit.
But it just so happens. I think I might have bagged us a sweet ass J - O - B.

V
Go on.

JACKIE
(demurs *slightly*)
I mean, maybe it's not as big as that, but...
Just that it's fronted by a little known fixer named *Dexter DeShawn* %% emphasis, sarcasm playing down, followed by delivery, which is emphasized to be significant. %%

JACKIE
(emphasizes words with chopstick stabbing the air)
Only the top fixer in Night fucking City!
Fat ass black Jesus of the afterlife.
300 pounds of partly gold plates *cool*.

[[S V Convo stage 2, Jackie has mentioned who the fixer is]]
