The mercenary rolls up to the curbside. From up on the hill, the whole district is laid out.
The basket ball court Reed mentions is perched on the side of the cliff. What must have once been an Amphitheatre is dilapidated and overgrown. A few people mill on stands while a group gathers on the court %% add an oddly specific detail %% ~~a man sorting them into two sides.~~

%% Arrival, action glance around look for Reed  %%

[[On initial arrival, the Mercenary looks over the group on the stands]]
The mercenary gets of their bike and pops the visor on their helmet, looking over the people on stands and in the court.
A motley collection from all walks of life enjoying last rays of afternoon before sun slips past the skyscrapers. A few spiked hair gangoons - firearms and bright neon cyberware on display. None that scream secret agent. A group of kids on oneside, electric scateboards leaning on stone seats who give the mercenary a glare back. %% trying to come up Something noteworthy, specific detail %%

The mercenary ignores the glares.
